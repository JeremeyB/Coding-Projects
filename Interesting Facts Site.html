   <h2><dl>Famous People From Ohio</dl></h2>
   <b><dt>Neil Armstrong</dt></b>
   <dd>Armstrong was an American astronaut and the first person to walk on the Moon. Trained as an aeronautical engineer, he served as a test pilot before being 
      selected as an astronaut. Interestingly, all his accomplishments would not have happened had Dick Day, not placed his application 
      for astronaut with the ones that arrived on time. Armstrong’s application had arrived about a week after the deadline. 
      Armstrong’s first mission into the space was as command pilot of Gemini 8 in 1966. 
      With this, he became the first civilian to fly in space. 
      His second and last space flight occurred three years later in 1969 when he joined Aldrin and Collins aboard Apollo 11 for NASA’s first manned mission to moon. 
      Armstrong spent about two hours walking on the moon surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments.</dd><br>
